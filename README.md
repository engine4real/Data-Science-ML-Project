This project uses Logistics Regression to analyse hate speech on Twitter.

we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. The project classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

I have sample of tweets and labels, label ‘1’ which denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and another label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, the code was able to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from the csv files, while the final result can be seen in the 'final_lreg_bow.csv'.
