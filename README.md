INTRODUCTION

Data Science is an interesting field. It encompasses the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data [1]. It is a relevant field because we have tons of data around that need to be utilized for effective running of our organizations or businesses. Excellent decisions can be made if data is interpreted the right way.

Here, we will be using Python programming language. It has become a very popular programming language and is being used by different industries like Technology companies, Finance, Government, Schools and many others. We will be uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind Airbnb datasets using Python programming language in Jupyter notebook.

MOTIVATION

Every business desires expansion and increase in sales. We are interested in the factors that makes a business succeed. Being motivated by that we will be using Airbnb as a case study. Airbnb as a business with other competitors in the market will always seek for ways to improve bookings and increase sales in each country and states and to stand out among other competitors. We have been saddled with the responsibility to analyze the Airbnb data and come up with positive recommendations for the management. We want to extract this data from public.opendatasoft.com platform, analyze them and check for insights hiding behind the data.

DATA SET AND DATA COLLECTION: We collected the dataset from Airbnb-Listing public.opendatasoft.com platform. The dataset has 494,954 records. Attached is the link for the dataset: https://urlzs.com/LJQy

OBJECTIVES

We will be exploring the data by answering some questions and at the end build a model to predict the price of Airbnb listings.
